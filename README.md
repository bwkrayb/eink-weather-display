This is another eink project, where I created a simple weather monitor using python. This was to rewrite code from someone else's project that I was using that I felt had way more features than I was really using, and I also just wanted to learn how to set this up myself.

It is automated by setting a crontab entry that will run the bin/start.sh script every 20 minutes. This should allow for easier control over the frequency of updates overnight, and also the possibility of having it run different screens. For now, it simply runs the weather.py and not many other files are used despite their existance.
